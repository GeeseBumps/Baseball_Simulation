# Baseball_Simulation

This is a project python file for Introduction to the Simulation and Modeling(KAIST) 

We simulated the baseball game. 

Our purpose of simulation was to figure out the efficiency of baseball strategy.

For example, is it really good to designate the best hitter as 4th hitter? Are there any more good ways to order hitters?

To validate this strategy, we used the real baseball data from KBO leage. You can check hitting rate for each hitter. 

By changing orders of players randomly, we found out that changing the order of hitters does statistically  matter.

You can try other examples also.
